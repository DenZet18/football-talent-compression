# Raw Data

Raw data files used in this project (e.g., player-season statistics for the Premier League) are not distributed in this repository due to licensing and size considerations.

To reproduce the analysis, obtain equivalent player-season datasets for the Premier League (2015–16 to 2023–24) and place them in this directory. The processed metrics in `data/processed/metrics_epl_2015_2024.csv` can be used directly for downstream analysis.
