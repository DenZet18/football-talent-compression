# Research Question
This project studies whether elite football has experienced talent distribution compression over time, characterized by a rising individual floor and a narrowing individual ceiling across positions.

# Metric Definitions
 Individual Ceiling
- Defined as the degree of separation between the top-performing players and their positional peers within a league-season
- Measured using role-specific performance metrics and standardized via z-scores

Individual Floor
- Defined as the competence level of the weakest regularly-used players
- Measured as the bottom quartile of the positional distribution (minimum 900 minutes)

Compression
- Evaluated through joint trends in ceiling and floor metrics over time

# Planned Extensions
A position-weighted, WAR-style composite impact metric is planned as a follow-up project for later seasons where richer event data is available.

# Notes
The initial implementation focuses on the English Premier League as a case study. The methodology is designed to generalize to other leagues with similar player-season data.
