This project studies whether elite football has experienced talent distribution compression over time, characterized by a rising individual floor and a narrowing individual ceiling across positions.

 Individual Ceiling
- Defined as the degree of separation between the top-performing players and their positional peers within a league-season
- Measured using role-specific performance metrics and standardized via z-scores

Individual Floor
- Defined as the competence level of the weakest regularly-used players
- Measured as the bottom quartile of the positional distribution (minimum 900 minutes)

Compression
- Evaluated through joint trends in ceiling and floor metrics over time
